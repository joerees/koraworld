  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">The African Kora Harp: A Historical and Contemporary Overview</h1>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The kora, a 21-string bridge-harp, is an emblematic musical instrument of West Africa,
    deeply intertwined with the cultural identity of the Mandinka people and other ethnic groups in the region.
    Its origins, construction, and evolution reflect a rich tapestry of history, tradition, and modern adaptation.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Historical Origins</h2>
  <p>
    The kora's history is deeply embedded in the 13th-century Mali Empire, where it played a crucial role in the <em>jali</em> (griot) tradition.
    Jalis are hereditary musicians and storytellers who utilize the kora to accompany oral histories, praise songs, and social ceremonies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mandinka oral tradition points to Kaabu as its origin, including legends like that of Jali Mady Wouling Cissoko, who received the kora from a spirit,
    first playing the song "Kelefaba."
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Traditional and Modern Tunings</h2>
  <p>
    Traditionally, the kora is tuned to one of several heptatonic scales: Tomoraba, Sauta, Hardino, and Silaba.
    These scales are culturally specific and not based on Western temperaments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern adaptations include 25-string koras and double-necked koras pioneered by artists like Seckou Keita for more tuning flexibility.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Construction and Design</h2>
  <p>
    The traditional kora is crafted from a calabash gourd covered in cowhide, with a hardwood neck and 21 strings arranged in two rows across a free-standing bridge.
    Strings were originally made from animal gut, played with thumbs and forefingers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, players often use nylon fishing line and modern tuning materials for durability and precision.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Cultural Significance and Modern Developments</h2>
  <p>
    The kora remains a vital part of West African heritage, used to narrate history and perform praise songs.
    While some musicians modernize it across genres, others preserve its traditional form and symbolism.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The kora embodies West Africaâ€™s rich musical and cultural legacy. With roots in the Mali Empire and continuous innovation,
    it bridges centuries of tradition and modern creativity, inspiring artists and audiences worldwide.
